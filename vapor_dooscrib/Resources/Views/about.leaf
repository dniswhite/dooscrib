            <p>An idea that came from watching my wife play <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draw-something-free/id488628250?mt=8">Draw Something</a>
            and I was wondering if I could create a similar drawing pad on the net.</p>
            <p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Concept (<strong>Done</strong>)</li>
                <p>Basic proof of concept with rough code.</p>
                <li>jQuery plugin (<strong>Done - read article <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/560229/DooScrib-A-jQuery-plugin-for-creating-a-simple-dra">here</a>.</strong>)</li>
                <p>Create a jQuery plugin to emcompass the basic development already done as a proof of concept.</p>
                <li>Shared Canvas (<strong>Current</strong>)</li>
                <p>The initial concept was developed with Node.js and Express using socket.io, for WebSocket communications, to enable a single shared canvas. The current solution still uses WebSockets but the backend is now developed with Swift using <a href="https://vapor.codes/">Vapor</a>.</p>
                <li>Groups and Rooms (<strong>In Development</strong>)</li>
                <p>Add abilities to create groups/rooms with each having their own shared canvas.</p>
                <li>More Features</li>
                <p>Submit an idea if you have one.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>For now enjoy what you can get from it. You can get the plugin source <a href="https://github.com/dniswhite/dooscrib">here</a>.</p>
